# From_Scratch_NN

This repository has Python scripts that I used to create a pilot Neural Network from scratch.

# Motivation

I have been admiring and challenging myself to learn to program most of the functions from scratch. I, therefore, challenged myself to read and understand Neural Network and then use the knowledge I had gained, with programming knowledge I possess, to write a Neural Network Python script from scratch.

**On upload, I will write a more detailed explanation of the various Python scripts in this repository.**

##### Happy Coding.
